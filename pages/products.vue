                    <p>In their simplest form, flexible circuits are PCBs made of materials that allow for a non-planar positioning within the end product. Typical materials are basically mostly polyimide-based, and can go under trade names such as Kapton (DuPont). Polyimide is a polymer of imide monomers:</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Due to their high temperature resistance and robustness, they have been enjoying diverse commercial applications in flexible PCBs most notably in display electronics in a variety of industries such as automotive, aerospace, portable electronics, medical, and LEDs.</p>

                   <h4 class="font-bold font-ubuntu">Applications for Flex Circuits</h4>
                   <p>Often flexible circuits are used for applications that have repeated flex cycles, such as cellular phones, doors, etc. A growing application for flexible circuits is their use as a connector in LED-based lighting systems. Often, there are two components: a metal substrate LED PCB; an FR-4 based digital driver PCB. These two devices are often connected with a high profile and sometimes costly connector cables. Using a flexible PCB in its place can offer a lower profile, slimmer design, and higher reliability.</p>
                   <p>Blind Vias start on an outer layer but terminate on an inner layer; Buried Vias exist only between inner layers and do not begin or terminate on an outer layer. Another variant of these technologies is stacked vias. Stacked vias are used when a blind via is required but exceeds an aspect ratio of 1:1 and cannot be formed through sequential lamination due to another blind or buried via beginning on the same layer as the blind via's termination layer.</p>
                   <h4 class="font-bold font-ubuntu">Applications</h4>
                   <p>Blind, buried, and stacked vias are used to save PCB real estate. Also, some of today's tight componentry requires blind vias to be used in order to properly fan out the internal traces of the component on various layers of the PCB.</p>

                    <hr class="w-12 h-1 bg-darkGreen-700 border-0 rounded "/>
                    <p>As the speed of signal switching on a PCB increases, the electrical properties of the traces carrying signals between devices become increasingly important. The impedance of a PCB trace is controlled by its configuration, dimensions (trace width and thickness and height of the dielectric laminate), and dielectric constant of the laminate. It is important to have a controlled impedance of various traces that are connecting active and passive components. A tightly controlled impedance matching of these traces ensures that the propagating signals do not result in any losses, part of the signal reflected and only a part transmitted. These reflections are likely to cause aberrations on the signal which may degrade circuit performance such as noises and low gain.</p>
                    <p class="font-manrope">It is important that the customer specifies the impedance values and tolerances for the board to be fabricated by us. Alpha provides solutions for design and final product verification and any other questions the customer may have.</p>
                    <p class="font-manrope">Standard impedance tolerances are within 10%. However, our engineering team routinely produces Controlled Impedance PCBs to hold 5% impedance tolerance. We are able to achieve this by maintaining a database of past stack-up and resulting thicknesses that allow our front-end engineers to run tight impedance calculations. Further, numerous in-process checks are made to ensure that fabrication results are as close to the designed values as possible.</p>

                    <hr class="w-12 h-1 bg-darkGreen-700 border-0 rounded "/>
                    <p>Typically embedded components include embedded resistance and embedded capacitance.  These passive components can occupy a great deal of the surface real estate of a PCB.  By embedding these to internal layers, not only can PCB sizes be reduced, but many cost increases are offset by higher production throughput making this a win-win situation for the PCB user.</p>
                    <h4 class="font-bold font-ubuntu">Embedded Resistance</h4>
                    <p>Our experience with embedded resistance has been primarily with materials from Ticer Corporation (www.ticertechnologies.com).  Their embedded resistance material can be procured on a variety of materials, including from suppliers Rogers and DuPont.  It's fairly easy to work with, making achieving discrete resistance values easier to achieve in consistency.</p>
                    <h4 class="font-bold font-ubuntu">Embedded Capacitance</h4>
                    <p>We've produced PCBs with embedded capacitance using 3M's C1012 rigid substrate and DuPont's Interra flexible substrates.  The challenge in manufacturing with these materials is that often, due to their thin properties (down to 0.5 mils), they are difficult to process through conventional equipment, making a flexible PCB supplier the ideal choice for producing this technology.</p>
